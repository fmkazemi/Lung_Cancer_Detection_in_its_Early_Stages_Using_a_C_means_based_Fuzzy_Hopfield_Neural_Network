# Lung_Cancer_Detection_in_its_Early_Stages_Using_a_C_means_based_Fuzzy_Hopfield_Neural_Network
Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in both men and women.

The early detection of lung cancer is a challenging problem due to the structure of the cancer 
cells, where most of the cells are over- lapped with each other. Our algorithm aims to detect 
cancer before a person has any symptoms, which can help finding cancer at an early stage when it 
might be easier for early detection and treatment of lung cancer. In particular, we propose a 
C-means based training of a Fuzzy Hopfield Neural Network and apply it to detect and segment cancer 
cells in images. We present a new objective function, and its minimization by a type of Lyapunov 
energy function which is based on a two dimensional Fuzzy Hopfield Neural Network. This objective 
function is the same energy function of the Hopfield Neural Network which is improved and includes 
average distance between image pixels and cluster centers. Our research will be done on lung cells 
images. There are currently no universally applicable criteria for validating image segmentation 
methods. Nevertheless, an impact criterion for performance evaluation is whether the method can 
indicate interest- ing or important regions in the image.Therefore, we will propose new criteria 
for solving this problem. An exploratory analysis will also be done to understand how this 
algorithm operates in comparison to the Hopfield Neural Network, Fuzzy C-Means, Gustafson-Kessel and
C-Means algorithms.
